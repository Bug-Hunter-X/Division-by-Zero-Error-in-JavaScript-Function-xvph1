This repository contains a JavaScript function with a common error: division by zero. The `bug.js` file demonstrates the flawed function, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that gracefully handles zero values.  The issue occurs when either of the inputs is 0, leading to an error. The solution incorporates proper checks and returns a more appropriate result or throws a specific error for better error handling.
